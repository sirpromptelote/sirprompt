# Concept

The initial idea of the project was to explore the capabilities of Stable diffusion to create content that could escape the current standard approach.
Considering it as a challenge, the project aims to use technology to create content to feed a storyline. The goal is to generate interconnected images that form a coherent and meaningful story, departing from the conventional random image generation approach.

## It's a graphic novel (NSFW)

It is a graphic novel focused on telling a story in the first person, following the Point of View camera angle (POV) The envisioned content is intended for an adult audience, and there may even be explicit content. I considered this aspect after exploring the capabilities of SD 1.5, as most of the trained models revolve around this theme.

Why NSFW?
By targeting an adult audience and including NSFW elements, I can delve into deeper, thought-provoking, and emotionally charged storylines. This can give the graphic novel a unique appeal, that maybe with a toned down narrative would be more difficult to my writing skills.
